    "logo": "logos/farsight.png",
    "requirements": ["An access to the Farsight Passive DNS API (apikey)", "The dnsdb2 python library"],
    "input": "A domain, hostname or IP address MISP attribute.",
    "output": "Passive-dns objects, resulting from the query on the Farsight Passive DNS API.",
    "references": ["https://www.farsightsecurity.com/", "https://docs.dnsdb.info/dnsdb-api/"],
    "features": "This module takes a domain, hostname or IP address MISP attribute as input to query the Farsight Passive DNS API.  \nThe results of rdata and rrset lookups are then returned and parsed into passive-dns objects.\n\nAn API key is required to submit queries to the API.  \nIt is also possible to define a custom server URL, and to set a limit of results to get.  \nThis limit is set for each lookup, which means we can have an up to the limit number of passive-dns objects resulting from an rdata query about an IP address, but an up to the limit number of passive-dns objects for each lookup queries about a domain or a hostname (== twice the limit).\n\nAdditionally to the lookup queries, responses from flex queries can be returned with the results.  \nTo get this additional data with the results, there is a `flex_queries` configuration parameter to set to `true`. The module submit then regex queries to the API, using the domain, hostname or IP address as keyword for the search. Passive-dns objects are returned next to the ones resulting from the lookup queries."

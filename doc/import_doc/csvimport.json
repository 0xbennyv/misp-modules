  "requirements": ["PyMISP"],
  "features": "In order to parse data from a csv file, a header is required to let the module know which column is matching with known attribute fields / MISP types.\nThis header is part of the configuration of the module and should be filled out in MISP plugin settings, each field separated by COMMAS. Fields that do not match with any type known in MISP can be ignored in import, using a space or simply nothing between two separators (example: 'ip-src, , comment, ').\nThere is also one type that is confused and can be either a MISP attribute type or an attribute field: 'comment'. In this case, using 'attrComment' specifies that the attribute field 'comment' should be considered, otherwise it will be considered as the MISP attribute type.\n\nFor each MISP attribute type, an attribute is created.\nAttribute fields that are imported are the following: value, type, category, to-ids, distribution, comment, tag.",
